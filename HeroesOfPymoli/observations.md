# Observations
Analysis of the purchase data from Heroes of Pymoli provides some useful observations of the player base and their purchasing patterns. The player base overwhelmingly identifies as male (84%). While this group makes up the majority of the player base, players who identify as female or Other / Non-Disclosed spend more on in-game purchases on average ($4.47 average total purchase for female players and $4.56 average total purchases for other palyers compared to $4.07 average for male players). The largest portion of the player base is between 20 to 24 years old (44.8%), and this age group spends $4.32 on average. Finally, the top spenders spend far above the verage for any age group ($13.10 - $18.96). Identifying the characteristics shared by top spenders may help identify ways to increase the number of top spenders.

The most profitable and popular items have prices between $4.23 and $4.90 which suggests the player base is comfortable with prices near $4.50. A few items are both very popular and highly profitable (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, and Fiery Glass Crusader). Their popularity and profitibility suggest that understanding these items will be useful in designing new items.
